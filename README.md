This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug related to using the Dimensions API before component layout is complete. The `BuggyDimensions.js` file shows the erroneous implementation, while `FixedDimensions.js` provides a corrected version using useEffect and layout dependencies.  The issue is that accessing screen dimensions immediately can lead to inaccurate values. The solution uses useEffect's dependency array to ensure that the dimensions are fetched only after the component has mounted and the layout is determined.
